Here I'm working with the data carpentry ecoli genomes data set. I found it at this website: http://rpubs.com/marschmi/117051


```{r set seed, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
set.seed(86032591)
```


Below I am importing the **ecoli data** from our data folder.

```{r Import Data, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
metadata <- read.csv('data/Ecoli_metadata.csv') # reading in my data file into an object named 'metadata' 
View(metadata) # looking at the table within R
?str # get help on str command
??str # all help pages with str in it
str(metadata) # want to look at structure of metadata file, but don't want it in my html doc
mean(metadata$genome_size) # looking at mean genome size in metadata file
```
